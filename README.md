Circadian
=========
CLOCK and BMAL1 biochemical autoregulatory transcriptors activate Period and Cryptochrome genes, and in turn the resulting proteins provide a feedback loop to the CLCOK and BMAL1 complex. Using ChIP-seq we are able to determine
the dynmaics of the core circadian clock system (CCS), and consequently provide a mechanistic view to promote understanding of how CCS influences behaviour, physiology, and can lead to the understanding and treatment of ailing behavioural and developmental disorders.

Cancer prevention
Human period 2 protein directly interacts with tumor suppressor proteins
HP2P can mutate or modify. This leads to the inability to prevent cellular division at certain tomes of the day
Happens within 80% of all examined cancer cases

Causing abnormal circadian rhythm can lead to malignant transforms.

Isolate particular protein and gene causing it.
Can lead to better control or cancer prevention/treatment.

Problems highlight the complexity of the circadian controlled network
and emphasise its physiological relevance for human health.

Internal timepiece that controls entire bodily cycle. Not just sleep wake eat.
